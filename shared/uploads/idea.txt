Search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo help us find information quickly. But have you ever wondered how they work? This topic explains the basic steps: Crawling – Search engines use bots (called web crawlers) to scan websites and collect data.  Indexing – The collected data is stored in a massive database. Ranking – When you search for something, algorithms rank pages based on relevance, keywords, and quality. Displaying Results – The most relevant pages appear on the search results page.
